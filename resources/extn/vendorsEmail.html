<p>Good afternoon all,</p>
<p>We have updated your vendor reports in your shared Google Drive folder for this week. As a reminder, new and updated vendor comments should be added to the "Response" column (Column AT) in the report in your shared Google Drive folder. Please do not edit or remove comments from the previous week in the Comments column (Column AR) so those can be used as a reference point during our bi-weekly meetings.</p>
<p>A GACA email will be needed to access the Google Drive folders. If any additional vendor members want to be added to the shared Google Drive, please create a GACA email, reply to this email, and we will add you to the appropriate shared drive.</p>
<p><strong><u>COFER Report Reminders From GSA:</u></strong></p>
<ul>
 <li>ALL Requisitions are now on the COFER report </li>
    <ul>
	 <li>Vendors will update estimated delivery dates in OMS by updating their EDI 855 IB</li>
	  <li>Vendors will use the response section of the COFER to explain expected delivery dates and the factors impacting those that are outstanding</li>
	</ul>	
 <li> Updated expected shipment dates will be reflected in Column AQ when vendors update their EDI 855 IB</li>
 <li> Please notify GSA for further action if unable to fulfill FY22 or older orders.</li>
 <li>WIWO orders greater than 30 days need to be invoiced next to the prior meeting date, if not, an updated status in the response column is required. </li>
 <li>If lines are invoiced but still appear on the report, please annotate the invoiced lines with "inv" and the invoice number in the response section.</li>
 <li>Referral orders over 100 days require an updated ESD if the date is past due in the response section. </li>
 <li>All Vendors are responsible for correctly reporting shipping notifications (EDI 856). Please notify GSA if any issues arise.</li>
 <li> A Shipped notification should only process when a requisition has been shipped to the customer or when the customer has received the product. Incorrect handling of Requisition Shipped notifications will remain on the COFER, please mark these lines for review (if applicable).</li>
 <li>For those remaining lines on the COFER report, where the vendor has erroneously shipped & will not invoice, or have partially shipped/invoiced orders on the report, please update status on these lines and report to GSA (if applicable)</li>
 <li><i>Please report partial cancellations to GSA for identification and action - If unable to cancel, please provide screenshot of response</i></li>
